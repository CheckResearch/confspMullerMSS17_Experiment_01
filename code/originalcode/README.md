# Original Code

This directory contains the code of the PRET toolkit this experiment has been conducted with. Please note that in order to keep the git repository small the code has not been copied into this directory. It has rather been added as  a [Git Submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) and will therefore not be pulled automatically when pulling the repository. In case you want to clone the PRET toolkit code please issue the following commands:

    # git submodule init
    # git submodule update

These commands should check the PRET code out into the `code/originalcode/PRET` directory.
